### Tasks

The mockup is divided into parts - the *profile widget*  at the top the *post widget*. 

DONE 1. Implement the *profile widget* **or** the *post widget* in a static web page. **It's not mandatory to implement both**.
DONE 2. Imagine a simple interaction and implement it with Javascript. For example users could...
   - toggle the follow button in the profile widget
   - or expand / collapse the post widget as shown in the picture.
DONE 3. When the implementation is finished, publish your prototype to a website and include the link to the website in your github repository.

### Technologies

But if you are already familliar with web development and you want to try something new ( let say [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) ) feel free to use whatever you'd like.
